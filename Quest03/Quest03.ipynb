force  our chitauri will follow  the world will be his and the universe yours  and the humans  what can they do  but burn  how bad is it  that s the problem  sir  we don t know  dr  selvig read an energy surge from the tesseract four hour ago  nasa didn t authorize selvig to pull the test phase  he wasn t testing it  he wasn t even in the room  spontaneous advancement it just turned itself on  what are the engine levels now  climbing  when selvig couldn t shut it down  we ordered the evac  how long to get everyone out  campus should be clear in the next half hour  do better  sir  evacuation maybe futile  we should tell them to go back to sleep  if we can t control the tesseract s energy  there may not be a minimum safe distance  i need you to make sure that phase sir  is that really a priority right now  until such time as the world ends  we will act as though it intends to spin on  clear out the tech below  every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone  yes  sir  come with me  talk to me  doctor    director    is there anything we know for certain    tesseract is misbehaving    is that supposed to be funny  no  it s not funny at all  the tesseract is not only active  she s   misbehaving   how soon until you pull the plug  she s an energy source  if we turn off the power  she turns it back on    if she reaches peak level      we ve prepared for this  doctor    harnessing energy from space    we don t have the harness  our calculations are far from complete  now she s throwing off interference  radiation nothing harmful  low levels of gamma radiation  that can be harmful  where s agent barton  the hawk  up in his nest  as usual  agent barton  report to me  i gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things    i can see better from a distance    are you seeing anything that might   set this thing off    doctor  it s spiking again  no one come or gone  it s oven is clean  no contacts  no i m  s  if there was any tampering  sir  it wasn t at this end    at this end    a cube of space  one end of the door  yeah  the cube is a doorway to the other end of space  right  the doors open from both sides  sir  please put down the spear  you have a heart  please don t    i still need that    this doesn t have to get any messier  of course it does  i ve come too far for anything else  i am loki of asgard    and i am burdened with glorious purpose

freedom  freedom is life s great lie  once you accept that  in your heart    you will know peace  yeah  you say peace  i kind of think you mean the other piece  sir  director fury is stalling  this place is about to blow drop a hundred feet of raw material  he means to bury us    like the pharaohs of odin    he was right  he s right  the portal is collapsing in on itself  you got maybe two minutes before this goes critical  drop him  need these vehicles    who s that    he didn t tell me  hill  do you copy  barton is     he s got the tesseract  track it down  ets go  no no no   leave

front  banner  you know  for a man who s supposed to be avoiding stress  you picked a hell of a place to settle  avoiding stress isn t the secret   then what is it  yoga  ou brought me to the edge of the city  smart  i uh   assume the whole place is surrounded  just you and me  and your actress buddy  is she a spy too  do you start that young    i did    who are you  natasha romanoff  are you here to kill me  miss romanoff  because that s not gonna work out for everyone  no  no  of course not  i m here on behalf of shield  shield  how did they find me  we never lost you  doctor  we ve kept our distance  even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent    why    nick fury seems to trust you  but now i need you to come in    what if i say no    i ll persuade you  and what if the   other guy says no  you ve been more than a year without an incident  i don t think you wanna break that streak  i don t get every time what i want  doctor  we re facing a potential global catastrophe    well  those i actively try to avoid    this is the tesseract  it has the potential energy to wipe out the planet    what does fury want me to do  swallow it    well  he wants you to find it  it s been taken  it omits a gamma signature that s too weak for us to trace  there s no one that knows gamma radiation like you do  if there was  that s where i d be    so fury isn t after the monster    not that he s told me  and he tells you everything    talk to fury  he needs you on this    he needs me in a cage    no one s gonna put you in a      stop lying to me  i m sorry  that was mean  i just

out of line  director  you re dealing with forces you can t control  you ever been in a war  councilman  in a firefight  did you feel an over abundance of control  you saying that this asgard has declared war on our planet  not asgard  loki  he can t be working alone  what about the other one  his brother  our intelligence says  thor is not a hostile  but he s worlds away  we can t depend on him to help either  it s up to us  which is why you should be focusing on phase 2    it was designed for exactly      phase 2 isn t ready  our enemy is    we need a response team    the avengers initiative was shut down    this isn t about the avengers    we have seen the list  we re running the world s greatest covert security network and you re gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks  i m not leaving anything to anyone  we need a response team  these people may be isolated  unbalanced even  but i believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need    you believe    war isn t won by sentiment  director  no  it s won by soldiers  there s not enough time  i m gotta pull into the water    you wont be alone     oh god  this guy is still alive  trouble sleeping  i slept for 70 years  sir  i think i ve had my fill  then you should be out  celebrating  seeing the world  i went under  the world was at war  i wake up  they say we won  they didn t say what we lost  we ve made some mistakes along the way  some very recently    you here with a mission  sir    i am    trying to get me back in the world    trying to save it  hydra s secret weapon  howard stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you  he thought what we think  the tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy  that s something the world sorely needs    who took it from you    he s called loki  he s not from around here  there s a lot we ll have to bring you up to speed on if you re in  the world has gotten even stranger than you already know  at this point  i doubt anything would surprise me  ten bucks says you re wrong  there s a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment  is there anything you can tell us about the tesseract that we ought to know now  you should have left it in the ocean  you re good to go on this end  the rest is up to you  you disconnected the transition lines  are we off the grid  stark towers is about to become a beacon of self sustaining clean energy  wow  so maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works  i assume  light her up    how does it look    like christmas  but with more   me  gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign  you need to do some press  i can do some more tomorrow  i m working on the zoning for the next billboards  pepper  you re killing me  remember  enjoy the moment  i remember  sir  agent coulson of shield is on the line  i m not in  i m actually out  sir  i m afraid he s insisting  close the line jarvis  i got a date  levels are holding steady   i think

from you  no  all this  came from that  give yourself some credit  please  stark tower   stark tower is your baby  give yourself  twelve percent of the credit    twelve percent    an argument can be made for fifteen    twelve percent for my baby    well  i did do all the heavy lifting  literally  i lifted the heavy things  and sorry  but the security snafu  that was on you    my private elevator    you mean our elevator  it was teeming with sweaty workmen  i m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later on  aren t i  not gonna be that subtle  i ll tell you what

things  so  let s trade  thank you  official consulting hours are between eight and five every other thursday    this isn t a consultation    is this about the avengers    which i   i know nothing about    the avengers initiative was scrapped  i thought    and i didn t even qualify    i didn t know that either  yeah  apparently i m volatile  self obsessed  don t play well with others    that i did know    this isn t about personality profiles anymore    whatever  miss potts  got a sec    you know  i thought we were having a moment    i was having twelve percent of a moment  this seems so

that s happening  the things that are about to come to light  people might just need a little old fashioned    the chitauri grow restless    let them grow restless    i will lead them in the glorious battle    battle  against a meagre might of earth    glorious  not lengthy  if your force is as formidable as you claim  you question us  question him  he who put the scepter in your hand  who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose  when you were cast out  defeated  i was a king  the rightful king of asgard  betrayed  your ambition is little and full of childish need  we look beyond the earth to great worlds the tesseract will avail  you don t have the tesseract yet  i don t threaten  but until i open the doors  until your force is mine to command  you are the wars    you will have your war as guardian  if you fail    if the tesseract is kept from us  there will be no realm  no barren moon  no crevasse where i can t find you  you think you know pain  you will receive something sweet as pain    get your captain equipment    all right  agent romanoff   he s captain rogers    they need you on the bridge    see you there  there was quite the buzz around here  finding you in the ice  i thought coulson was gonna swoon  did he ask you to sign his captain america trading cards yet    trading cards    they re vintage  he s very proud  dr  banner  oh  yeah  hi    they told me you

coming    thanks for asking nicely    so  uh   how long am i staying    once we get our hands on the tesseract  you re in the clear  where are you with that  we re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet  cell phones  laptops  if it s connected to a satellite    it s eyes and ears for us    that s still not gonna find them in time  you have to narrow the field  how many spectrometers do you have access to    how many are there    call every lab you know  tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays  i ll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition  at least we could rule out a few places    do you have somewhere for me to work    agent romanoff  would you show dr  banner to his laboratory  please  you re gonna love it  doc  we got all the toys    put over there    is this the stuff you need    yeah  iridium  it s found in meteorites  it forms anti protons    it s very hard to get hold of   specially if shield knows you need it  well  i didn t know  the tesseract is showing me so much  it s   it s more than knowledge  it s truth  i know  what did it show you  agent barton    my next target    tell me what you need  i need a distraction  and an eyeball  i mean  if it s not too much trouble  no  no  it s fine  it s a vintage set  it took me a couple of years to collect them all  near mint  slight foxing around the edges  but    we got a hit  sixty seven percent match  weight  cross match  seventy nine percent    location    stuttgart  germany  28  canning strasse    he s not exactly hiding    captain  you re up  kneel before me  i said  kneel  is not this simpler  is this not your natural state  it s the unspoken truth of humanity  that you crave subjugation  the bright lure of freedom diminishes your life s joy in a mad scramble for power  and identity  you were made to be ruled  in the end  you will always kneel  not to men like you    there are no men like me    there are always men like you  look to your elder  people  let him be an example  you know  the last time i was in germany and saw a man standing above everybody else  we ended up disagreeing  i m not the one who s out of time  loki  drop the weapon and stand down  kneel  not today  the guy s all over the place  agent romanoff  did you miss me  make your move  reindeer names  good move    mr stark    captain    didn t he say anything    not a word  just get in here  we re low on time    i don t like it    what  rock of ages giving up so easily  i don t remember it being that easy  this guy packs a wallop  still  you were pretty spry  for an older fellow    what s your thing  pilates    what  it s like calisthenics  you might have missed a couple things  you know  doing time as a capsicle    fury didn t tell me he was calling you in    yeah  there s a lot of things fury doesn t tell you  where s this coming from  what s the matter  scared of a little lightning  i m not overly fond of what follows    now there s that guy    another asgardian    think the guy s a friendly    doesn t matter  if he frees loki or kills him  the tesseract s lost    stark  we need a plan of attack    i have a plan  attack    i d sit this one out  cap    i don t see how i can  these guys come from legends  they re basically gods  there s only one god  ma am  and i m pretty sure he doesn t dress like that    where s the tesseract    i missed you too    do i look to be in a gaming mood    oh  you should thank me  with the bifrost gone  how much dark energy did the all father have to muster to conjure you here  your precious earth  i thought you dead  did you mourn    we all did  our father      your father  he did tell you my true parentage  did he not  we were raised together  we played together  we fought together    do you remember none of that    i remember a shadows  living in the shade of your greatness  i remember you tossing me into an abyss    i who was and should be king    so you take the world i love as recompense for your imagined slights  no  the earth is under my protection  loki  and you re doing a marvelous job with that  the humans slaughter each other in droves  while you ideally threat    i mean to rule them  that s why should i not      think yourself above them    well  yes    then you miss the truth of ruling  brother  a throne would suit you ill  i ve seen worlds you ve never known about  i have grown  odin s son  in my exile  i have seen the true power of the tesseract  and when i wield it    who showed you this power  who controls the would be king    i am the king    not here  you give up the tesseract  you give up this poisonous dream  you come home  i do not have it  you need the cube to bring me home  but i ve sent it off  i know not where  you listen well  brother  i m listening    do not touch me again    then don t take my stuff  you have no idea what you re dealing with  uh   shakespeare in the park  doth mother know  you weareth her drapes  this is beyond you  metal man  loki will face asgardian justice  he gives up the cube and he s all yours  until then  stay out of the way  tourist  okay  how about that  thats enough    now  i don t know what you plan on doing here    i ve come here to put and end to loki s schemes  then prove it  put that hammer down  uh   yep  no  bad call  he loves his hammer  you want me to put the hammer down  are we done here  in case it s unclear  you try to escape  you so much as scratch that glass  thirty thousand feet  straight down in a steel trap  you get how that works  ant  boot  it s an impressive cage  not built  i think  for me  built for something a lot stronger than you  oh  i ve heard  the mindless beast  makes play to be the man  how desperate are you  you call on these lost creatures to defend you  how desperate am i  you threaten my world with war  you steal a force you can t hope to control  you talk about peace and you kill cause it s fun  you have made me very desperate  you might not be glad that you did  ooh  it burns you to come so close  to have the tesseract  to have power  unlimited power  and for what  a world for all mankind to share    and then to be reminded what real power is     well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something     he really grows on you  doesn t he    loki s gonna drag this out    so  thor  what s his play    he has an army called the chitauri  that none of asgard nor any world know  he means to lead them against your people  they will win him the earth    return  i suspect  for the tesseract    an army    from outer space    so he s building another portal    that s what he needs erik selvig for    selvig    he s an astrophysicist    he s a friend  loki has him under some kind of spell    along with one of ours    i wanna know why loki let us take him    he s not leading an army from here    i don t think we should be focusing on loki  that guy s brain is a bag full of cats  you could smell crazy on him  i don t care how you speak  loki is beyond reason  but he is of asgard  and he s my brother  he killed eighty people in two days    he s adopted    i think its about the mechanics    iridium  what did they need the iridium for    it s a stabilizing agent  means the portal won t collapse on itself  like it did at shield  no hard feelings point break  you ve got a mean swing  also  it means the portal can open as wide  and stay open as long  as loki wants  that man is playing gallaga  thought we wouldn t notice  but we did    how does fury even see these    he turns  sounds exhausting  the rest of the raw materials  agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily  only major component he still needs is a power source  a high energy density  something to kick start the cube  when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics  last night  the packet  selvig s notes  the extraction theory papers  am i the only one who did the reading  does loki need any particular kind of power source  he got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the coulomb barrier  unless  selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect  well  if he could do that he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet  finally  someone who speaks english    is that what just happened    it s good to meet you  dr  banner  you re work on anti electron collisions is unparalleled  and i m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster    thanks    dr  banner is only here to track the cube    i was hoping you might join him    let s start with that stick of his it may be magical  but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon  i don t know about that  but it is powered by the cube  and i d like to know how loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys    monkeys  i do not understand    i do    i understood that reference    shall we play it  doctor    this way  sir  the gamma readings are definitely consistent with selvig s reports on the tesseract    but it s gonna take weeks to process    if we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the homer cluster  we can clock this around six hundred teraflops  all i packed was a tooth brush  you know  you should come by stark towers sometime top ten floors  all r and d    you d love it  it s candy land    thanks  but the last time i was in new york i kind of broke harlem  well  i promise a stress free environment  no tension  no surprises    nothing    are you nuts  you really have got a lid on it  haven t you  what s your secret    mellow jazz  bongo drums  huge bag of weed    is everything a joke to you    threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn t funny    no offense  doctor    no  it    it s alright  i wouldn t have come aboard if i couldn t   handle pointy things    you re tiptoeing  big man    you need to strut    and you need to focus on the problem  mr  stark  you think i m not  why did fury call us and why now  why not before  what isn t he telling us  i can t do the equation unless i have all the variables    you think fury s hiding something    he is a spy  he s a spy  captain  he s the spy  his secrets have secrets  it s bugging him too  isn t it    uh  i just wanna finish my work here and      doctor  a world for all mankind  loki s jab at fury about the cube    i heard it    well  i think that was meant for you  even if barton didn t post that all over the news  the stark tower  that big ugly        building in new york  it s powered by stark reactors  self sustaining energy source    that building will run itself for what  a year    that s just the prototype  i m kind of the only name in clean energy right now  so why didn t shield bring him in on the tesseract project  i mean  what are they doing in the energy business in the first place  i should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of shield s secure files    i m sorry  did you say         jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge  in a few hours we ll know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide    blueberry    yet you re confused about why they didn t want you around  an intelligence organization that fears intelligence  historically not possible  i think loki s trying to wind us up  this is a man who means to start a war  and if don t stay focused  he ll succeed  we have orders  we should follow them  following is not really my style  and you re all about style  aren t you  of the people in this room  which one is  a wearing a spangly outfit  and b  not of use  steve  tell me none of this smells a little funky to you  just find the cube  that s the guy my dad never shut up about  wondering if they shouldn t have kept him on ice  the guy s not wrong about loki  he does have the jump on us  what he s got is an acme dynamite kit  it s gonna blow up in his face  and i m gonna be there when it does   and i ll read all about it  or you ll be suiting up like the rest of us  ah  see  i don t get a suit of armor  i m exposed  like a nerve    it s a nightmare    you know  i ve got a cluster of shrapnel  trying every second to crawl its way into my heart  this stops it  this little circle of light  it s part of me now  not just armor    it s a terrible privilege    but you can control it    because i learned how    it s different  hey  i ve read all about your accident  that much gammer exposure should have killed you  so you re saying that the hulk  the other guy  saved my life  that s nice  it s a nice sentiment  save it for what  i guess we ll find out    you may not enjoy that    you just might  as soon as loki took the doctor we moved jane foster  we ve got an excellent observatory in traunsee  she was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday  handsome fee  private plane  very remote    she ll be safe    thank you  it s no accident loki taking erik selvig  i dread what he plans for him once he s done    erik is a good man    he talks about you a lot  you changed his life    you changed everything around here    they were better as they were  we pretend on asgard that we re more advanced  but we  we come here battling like bilchsteim    like what    bilchsteim  you know  huge  scaly  big antlers    you don t have those    i don t think so  they are repulsive  and they trample everything in their path  when i first came to earth  loki s rage followed me here and your people paid the price  and now again  n my youth i courted war  war hasn t started yet  you think you can make loki tell us what the tesseract is  i do not know  loki s mind is far afield  it s not just power he craves  it s vengeance upon me  there s no pain that would prise his need from him  a lot of guys think that  until the pain stops    what are you asking me to do    i m asking  what are you prepared to do  loki is a prisoner  then why do i feel like he s the only person on this boat that wants to be here  there s not many people that can sneak up on me   but you figured i d come after  after whatever tortures fury can concoct  you would appear as a friend  as a balm    and i would cooperate    i wanna know what you ve done to agent barton  i d say i ve expanded his mind  and once you ve won  once you re king of the mountain  what happens to his mind    is this love  agent romanoff    love is for children  i owe him a debt  tell me  before i worked for shield  i i made a name for myself  i have a very specific skillset  i didn t care who i used it for  or on  i got on shield s radar in a bad way  agent barton was sent to kill me  he made a different call  and what will you do if i vow to spare him    i ll not let you out    ah  no  but i like this your world in the balance  and you bargain for one man  regime s fall everyday  i tend not to weep over that  i m russian  or i was    and what are you now    it s really not that complicated  i ve got red in my ledger  i d like to wipe it out  can you  can you wipe out that much red  drakoff s daughter  sao paulo  the hospital file  barton told me everything  your ledger is dripping  it s gushing red  and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything  this is the basest sentimentality  this is a child at prayer  pathetic  you lie and kill in the service of liars and killers  you pretend to be separate  to have your own code  something that makes up for the horrors  but they are a part of you  and they will never go away  i won t barter barton  not until i make him kill you  slowly  intimately  in every way he knows you fear  and then he ll wake just long enough to see his good work  and when he screams i ll split his skull this is my bargain  you mewling quin  you re a monster  oh  no  you brought the monster    so  banner  that s your play    what  loki means to unleash the hulk  keep banner in the lab  i m on my way  set the door locked  thank you  for your cooperation    what are you doing  mr  stark    kind of been wondering the same thing about you   you re supposed to be locating the tesseract    we are  the model s locked and we re sweeping for the signature now  when we get a hit  we ll have the location within half a mile  and you ll get your cube back  no muss  no fuss  what is phase 2  phase 2 is shield used the cube to make weapons   sorry  the computer was moving a little slow for me   rogers  we gathered everything related to the tesseract this does not     mean that we re     i m sorry  nick  what were you lying    i was wrong  director  the world hasn t changed a bit    do you know about this    you wanna think about removing yourself from this environment  doctor    i was in calcutta  i was pretty well removed    loki s manipulating you    and you ve been doing what exactly    you didn t come here because i bat my eyelashes at you    yes  and i m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy  i d like to know why shield is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction  because of him    me    last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town  we learned that not only are we not alone  but we are hopelessly  hilariously   out gunned    my people want nothing but peace with your planet  but you re not the only people out there  are you  and  you re not the only threat  the world s filling up with people who can t be matched    they can t be controlled    like you controlled the cube  you re work with the tesseract is what drew loki to it  and his allies  it is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war    a higher form    you forced our hand we had to come up with something  a nuclear deterrent  cause that always calms everything right down  remind me again how you made your fortune  stark    i m sure if he still made weapons  stark would be neck deep      wait  wait  hold on  how is this now about me    i m sorry  isn t everything    i thought humans were more evolved than this    excuse me  did we come to your planet and blow stuff up    we can     you speak of control  yet you court chaos    it s his m o   isn t it  i mean  what are we  a team  no  no  no  we re a chemical mixture that makes chaos  we re   we re a time bomb    you need to step away    why shouldn t they guy let off a little steam    you know damn well why  back off    oh  i m starting to want you to make me  yeah  big man in a suit of armor    take that off  what are you    genius  billionaire  playboy  philanthropist  i know guys with none of that worth ten of you  i ve seen the footage  the only thing you really fight for is yourself  you re not the guy to make the sacrifice play  to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you  i think i would just cut the wire  always a way out  you know  you may not be a threat  but you better stop pretending to be a hero a hero  like you  you re a laboratory experiment  rogers  everything special about you came out of a bottle  put on the suite  let s go a few rounds    you people are so petty  and tiny    yes  right    agent romanoff  would you escort dr  banner back to his   where  you re renting my room    the cell was just      in case you needed to kill me  but you can t  i know  i tried  i got low  i didn t see an end  so i put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out  so i moved on  i focused on helping other people  i was good until you dragged me back into this freak show  and put everyone here at risk  you wanna know my secret  agent romanoff  you wanna know how i stay calm  dr  banner  put down the scepter  all right    sorry  kids  you don t get to see my party trick after all    located the tesseract    i can get there faster    the tesseract belongs on asgard    no human is a match for it    you re not going alone  you gonna stop me  put on the suit  let s find out    i m not afraid to hit an old man    put on the suit  oh  my god    put on the suit    yep    hill    its a detonation  number three engines is down   we re been hit   fire engines    talk to me    turbine looks mostly intact    but it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there  if we lose one of engine we wont be    someone gonna get outside and patch the engine    stark  did you capy that    i m on it  okay  you okay right  keep that engine down  attention wait the cameras going dark  stay close  level four  engine three  i ll meet you there  doctor  bruce  you gotta fight  this is just what loki wants  we re gonna be okay  listen to me  we re gonna be okay  right  i swear on my life i will get you out of this  you will walk away  and never    your life  bruce  we have been carrying 180 to the south  takes us to the water  free wind  navigation recalibration after the engine failure    is the sun coming up    yes sir  then put it on the left  takes us on the water  one more turbine goes down we re trapped  stark    stark  i m here    good  see what we got  i gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before i can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris  i need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position  what s it look like in there  it seems to run on some form of electricity  well  you re not wrong  we re not your enemies  banner  try to think  the relays are intact    what s our next move    even if i clear the rotors  this thing won t re engage without a jump    i m gonna have to get in there and push    well if that thing gets up to speed  you ll get shredded  then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag     speak english  see that red lever  it ll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out  stand by it  wait for my word  i need full evac on lower deck  grenade  we gotta perimeter breach  hostile wiped shield gear  hulk and thor are in the research level sir  the hulk will tear this place apart    get his attention    escorts  six o proceed to the    don t get too close  target acquired  target engaged  target in moving  engine now all shut down  sir we lost all engine one  it s barton  he took out our system  he s headed for the detention lab  does anybody copy  this is agent romanoff i copy    stark we losing altitude    i have noticed  no  are you ever not going to fall for that  the humans think us immortal  should we test that  move away please  do you like this  we started working on the prototype after you sent the destroyer  even i don t know what it does  do you wanna find out  no  natasha     you re gonna lose  am i  it s in your nature  you re heroes are scattered  your floating fortress falls from the sky    where is my disadvantage    your lack conviction  i don t think i    so that s what it does    cap  need a lever    i need a minute here  lever  now  i m sorry  boss  they got rabbited  just stay awake  eyes on me   no  i m clockin  out here   not an option  it s okay  boss  this was never gonna work if they didn t have something to      agent coulson is down    the medical team on the way to the location    they re here  these were in phil coulson s jacket  guess he never did get you to sign them  we re dead in the air up here  our communications  location of the cube  banner  thor  i got nothing for you  lost my one good eye  maybe i had that coming  yes  we were going to build an arsenal with the tesseract  i never put all my chips on that number though  because i was playing something even riskier  there was an idea  stark knows this  called the avengers initiative  the idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people  see if they could become something more  see if they could work together when we needed them to  to fight the battles that we never could  phil coulson died still believing in that idea  in heroes  well  it s an old fashioned notion  you fell out of the sky    did i hurt anybody    there s nobody around here to get hurt  you did scare the hell out of some pigeons though    lucky    or just good aim  you were awake when you fell    you saw    the whole thing  right through the ceiling  big and green and buck ass nude  here    i didn t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella  thank you    are you an alien    what    from outer space  an alien    no  well then  son  you ve got a condition  clint  you re gonna be alright  you know that  is that what you know  i got   i gotta go in though  i gotta flush him out    we don t have that long  it s gonna take time    i don t understand  have you ever had someone take your brain and play  pull you out and send something else in  do you know what it s like to be unmade  you know that i do  why am i back  how did you get him out  cognitive recalibration  i hit you really hard in the head  thanks  natasha    how many agents    don t  don t do that to yourself  clint  this is loki  this is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for    loki  he got away    yeah  i don t suppose you know where  i didn t need to know  i didn t ask  he s gonna make his play soon though  today    we gotta stop him    yeah  who s we  i don t know  who s ever left  well  if i put an arrow in loki s eye socket  i d sleep better i suppose  now you sound like you  but you don t  you re a spy  not a soldier  now you want to wade into a war  why  what did loki do to you  he didn t  i just    natasha  i ve been compromised  i got red in my ledger  i d like to wipe it out    was he married    no he was a   cellist  i think  i m sorry  he seemed like a good man    he was an idiot    why  for believing    for taking on loki alone    he was doing his job  he was out of his league  he should have waited  he should have      sometimes there isn t a way out  tony    right  how did that work for him    is this the first time you ve lost a soldier    we re not soldiers    i m not marching to fury s fife    neither am i  he s got the same blood on his hands that loki does  but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done  now loki needs a power source  if we can put together a list    he made it personal    that s not the point    that is the point  that s loki s point    he hit us all right where we live  why    to tear us apart  he had to conquer his greed  but he knows he has to take us out to win  right  that s what he wants  he wants to beat us  he wants to be seen doing it    he wants an audience    right  i caught his act in stuttgart  yeah  that s just previews  this is    this is opening night  and loki  he s a full tail diva  he wants flowers  he wants parades  he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered  i hope that would be true    time to go    go where  i ll tell you on the way  can you fly one of those jets  i can  you got a suit  yeah  then suit up    you guys aren t authorized to be in here    son  just don t  sir  done is jacket  ranugal ranugal they needed to push  they found it  get our communications back up whatever you have to do    i want eyes on everything    yes sir  this device has already self sustainig    shut it down  dr  selvig    it s too late  it can t stop now  he wants to show us something    a new universe    okay  the barrier is pure energy  it s unbreachable  yeah i get that  plan b    sir  mark 7 is not ready for deployment    then skip the spinning ring we re run out of clock  please tell me you re going to appeal to my humanity    uh   actually  i m planning to threaten    you should have left your armor on for that  yeah  it s seen a bit of mileage  you ve got the blue stick of destiny    stalling me won t change anything    no  no  no  threatening  the chitauri are coming  nothing will change that    what have i to fear    the avengers  it s what we call ourselves  sort of like a team  earth s mightiest heroes type of thing    yes  i ve met them    yeah  takes us a while to get any traction  i ll give you that one  but  let s do a head count here  your brother  the demi god a super soldier  a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend a man with breath taking anger management issues a couple of master assassins  and you  big fella you ve managed to piss off every single one of them    that was the plan    not a great plan  when they come  and they will  they ll come for you    i have an army    we have a hulk   i thought the beast had wandered off   you re missing the point  there s no throne  there is no version of this  where you come out on top  maybe your army comes and maybe it s too much for us  but it s all on you  because if we can t protect the earth  you can be damned well sure we ll avenge it  how will your friends have time for me  when they re so busy fighting you    it should work    well  performance issues  you know  jarvis  anytime now    you will all fall before me  and there s one other person you pissed off  his name is phil  right  army  loki  turn off the tesseract or i ll destroy it  you can t  there is no stopping it    there is only the war    so be it    stark  we re heading north east    what  did you stop for drive through  swing that park  i m gonna lay them out for you    so we have more incoming    lets keep them occupied    nat    did you see them  we need back up there    stark  are you seeing this    i m seeing  still working on believing     where s banner  has he shown up yet    banner  just keep me posted  jarvis  find me a soft spot  look at this  look around you  you think this madness will end with your rule  it s too late  it s too late to stop it  no  we can  together  sentiment  you got civilian trap in the roof  loki  there more down there    we got this  go go    you think you can hold them off  captain  it would be my genuine pleasure    just like budapest all over again    you and i remember budapest very differently  national guard  does the army know what s happening here  do we  i need men in these buildings  there are people inside that can run into the line of fire  you take them through the basement or through the subway  you keep them off the streets   i need a perimeter as far back as 39th    why the hell should i take orders from you  i need men in those buildings  lead the people down and away from the streets i wanna shut off the perimeter all the way down of 39 street  well  we got its attention  where it heads to    lets thor hear what says    the powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable thor is right  we gotta deal with these guys    how do we do this  as a team    i have unfinished business with loki    yeah  get in line    save it  save it  loki s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that s what we need  without him these things could run wild  we got stark up top  he s gonna need us    so  this all seems horrible    i ve seen worse    sorry  no  we could use a little worse    stark  we got him    banne    just like you said    tell him to suit up  i m bringing the party to you  i don t see how that s a party  dr  banner  dr  banner  now might be a good time for you to get angry  that s my secret  captain  i m always angry  hold on  send the rest  guys    call it  captain  alright  listen up  until we can close that portal up there  we re gonna use containment  barton

turn  turn  this way  director fury  the council has made a decision  i recognize the council has made a decision  but given that it s a stupid assed decision  i ve elected to ignore it  director  you
